There are so many new breakthroughs in the payment industry that other has failed to catch up on. In addition, a new system, Stripe, is positioning itself as a top technology in the payment gateway system.
-  Authorization _:_ we decided to use JWT. We make sure the user who is sending requests to your server is the same user who logged in during authentication. This is usually done using Sessions, where a session ID is sent down to the browser's cookies and moved ahead to authorize the user.
