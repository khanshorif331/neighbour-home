Name: NeighborHome ( management portal type website )

Goal: 

Our most important target is E-builder. We want to provide a technology-based commercial system.  Building Management Systems Play an important role in the current instructional system. The authorities nowadays are using this amazing Management System to manage and supply a better experience by a software system to both ( Buyers and sellers ) effectively.  That's our goal.


### Features: 

* Home Model __:__  The model information can be found and can be bought by the seller. Admin can update those.
* Feedback __:__ Buyer can give feedback about Home Model or any Engineers.
* Authorization __:__  we decided to use JWT. We make sure the user who is sending requests to your server is the same user who logged in during authentication. This is usually done using Sessions, where a session ID is sent down to the browser's cookies and moved ahead to authorize the user.
* Chatbot __:__ Implemented a chatbot with which Buyer can chat. Where they get some guidelines and how to contact us.
* Email Bombing  __:__ When the admin posts any new announcement, every user, seller, and buyer will receive an email if he was registered.
* Dashboard  __:__ Make a dashboard for different roles. Like buyers, sellers, and an admin who can organize this site and update information. Every user has their own access and they are showing only their permitted page.
* Open Magazine  __:__ There is an Open library from where students can read free pdf books. Besides they can be permitted to download some books.
* Discount __:__ Another interesting feature implemented by which admin can find the top 10 buyers in a month and give them a special discount.
* Admin __:__ Admin can manage all the users and sellers. He can update demos info and add a new Home Model. He can update the notice board.
* Stay Dream Home  __:__ An interesting feature implemented by which different people can register (few payments) and visit our home 2 days 1 night.
* Blog  __:__ There will be a blog section. In which sellers can post different blogs. 
* Payment method __:__ we decided to use stripe. It is easy to set up for recurring payments. Payment Gateway is always an important question for merchants. There are so many new breakthroughs in the payment industry that other has failed to catch up on. In addition, a new system, Stripe, is positioning itself as a top technology in the payment gateway system.
